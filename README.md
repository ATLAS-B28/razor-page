## REST:
A common pattern for building APIs with HTTP
### Representational State Transfer (REST) 
is an architectural style for building web services. REST requests are made over HTTP. They use the same HTTP verbs that web browsers use to retrieve webpages and send data to servers. The verbs are:

#### GET: Retrieve data from the web service.
#### POST: Create a new item of data on the web service.
#### PUT: Update an item of data on the web service.
#### PATCH: Update an item of data on the web service by describing a set of instructions about how the item should be modified. The sample application in this module doesn't use this verb.
#### DELETE: Delete an item of data on the web service.

Web service APIs that adhere to REST are called RESTful APIs. They're defined through:

A base URI.
HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE.
A media type for the data, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or XML.
